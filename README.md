# ðŸ§© Maze Solver - Mahindra University Hackathon 2024

This project was created during the Mahindra University Hackathon 2024. The challenge involved solving a maze presented in a PNG image. The maze includes:

- **White areas**: valid paths
- **Black/Green areas**: walls (not traversable)
- **Yellow dot**: starting point
- **Red dot**: ending point

The task was to detect the start and end points, understand the maze layout, and compute a valid path using various algorithms.
